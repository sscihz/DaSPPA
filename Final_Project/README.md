## The V-Dem Dataset
Includes the world's most comprehensive and detailed democracy ratings. The latest version of the dataset and associated reference documents can be downloaded free of charge below. Click [here](https://www.v-dem.net/data/the-v-dem-dataset/) for details.

## V-Indoc Dataset

The Varieties of Indoctrination (V-Indoc) dataset is a global dataset on the politicization of education and the media, which is created using the [V-Dem](#the-v-dem-dataset) infrastructure and draws on the information provided by 760 country experts. The dataset offers unrivaled coverage of 160 countries from 1945-2021, and presents a wide array of unique indices and indicators on indoctrination efforts in education and the media. The data should facilitate richer and more expansive empirical examinations of the causes and consequences of indoctrination around the world and over time. In addition to our own original data, we further provide harmonised variables for existing education and media data (e.g. World Bank, UNESCO) to provide the most comprehensive data on these topics.

## Quantified Political Relationships

The Quantified Political Relationships (QPR) data provide a new comparative measure of cooperation and conflict in public relationships among politicians, non-partisan political actors, and societal actors. The author uses more than 250,000 machine-coded events from 13 Western European countries from 2001 to 2014 and scale them using latent factor network models. This provides information on the degree of cooperation and conflict between almost 3,500 (aggregated) or more than 4,600 (non-aggregated) actors.

## Integrated Crisis Early Warning System

The Integrated Crisis Early Warning System (ICEWS) combines a database of political events and a system using these to provide conflict early warnings. It is supported by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency in the United States. The database as well as the model used by Lockheed Martin Advanced Technology Laboratories are currently undergoing operational test and evaluation by the United States Southern Command and United States Pacific Command.Click [here](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataverse/icews) for details.

## Aiddata Project

Housed at William & Mary's Global Research Institute, AidData connects decision-makers and researchers who have a shared interest in working together using granular data and innovative tools to solve pressing problems, precisely target resources, and use rigorous evidence to measure the impacts—intended and unintended—of policies and investments.

## Politicians’ Private Sector Jobs and Parliamentary Behavior

This dataset contains information on second jobs held by Members of Parliament (MPs) in the UK House of Commons from 2010 to 2016. The data was sourced from the publicly available Register of Members' Financial Interests, which originally recorded MPs' outside earnings. It covers a total of 845 MPs from the Conservative and Labour parties. The dataset includes comprehensive hand-coded data on annual private sector earnings for each MP during this period, specifically for "remunerated directorships" and "remunerated employment, office, profession, etc." All incomes have been adjusted for inflation and are presented in constant 2015 British pounds.

## United Nations General Assembly Voting Data

This is a dataset of roll-call votes in the UN General Assembly 1946-2021 (sessions 1-76), note that some votes in the 76th session take place in 2022. Note that for the four most recent years, failed votes and votes on amendments and paragraphs have not yet been added. Moreover, "important votes" are also not yet coded for these years. The dataset includes issue codes and descriptions. It also contains ideal point estimates derived from these votes as described in Bailey, Michael A., Anton Strezhnev, and Erik Voeten. "Estimating dynamic state preferences from United Nations voting data." Journal of Conflict Resolution 61.2 (2017): 430-456.

## The Makeup of The CCP Elite
Drawing on years of data collection work headed up by UC San Diego’s Victor Shih and updated in the Summer of 2022, the [China Data Lab CCP Elite Portal](https://chinadatalab.ucsd.edu/elites/) allows users to visualize the key characteristics of over 2000 Chinese Communist Party elites, active government officials now starting from the 15th Party Congress (1997) going up through the 19th Party Congress (2017).  Using the portal, you can easily access visualizations detailing the elite’s age, party rank, work position, education level, gender, ethnicity, birth province, and alma mater. This tool allows scholars and interested members of the public to gain insight into the demographics of China’s ruling class and how it has changed from Jiang Zemin to Xi Jinping.

## China City Yearbook
The China City Yearbook is a comprehensive database of city-level statistics for China from 1990s to the present. The database includes data on population, economic activity, and urbanization, as well as data on the political and administrative structure of cities. You can find the data in this repo. 

## China Historical GIS
The CHGIS project has produced a comprehensive series of datasets related to the administrative geography of Chinese History. The data layers include nationwide coverages (for the years 1820 and 1911), and time series (for the Dynastic period from 221 BCE to 1911 CE). The administrative features include Provinces, Circuits, Prefectures, and Counties as they changed over time. Supplemental datasets include G.W. Skinner regional systems, Buddhist sites, features from historic Russian maps of China, Tibetan townships, modern gazetteer layers for each province, and many others. All CHGIS data is published for free academic use, and the contents are made available for online searching and access via XML webservice.

## China Biographical Database Project
The long-term goal of CBDB is systematically to include all significant biographical material from China’s historical record and to make the contents available free of charge, without restriction, for academic use. That data is regularly being enriched and new biographical entries are being created for Tang, Five Dynasties, Liao, Song, Jin, Yuan, Ming, and Qing figures.

## Spatial Data from China Data Lab

The objective of the China Data Lab is to build a core infrastructure for disseminating and utilizing spatiotemporal data, particularly data from China, to support case-based study and training. It will allow researchers to discover geospatial data from multiple sources, conduct spatial data analysis with GIS and statistics tools on the cloud, develop data-driven study cases, and share data and results as a package with others online. The platform will also support case-based training programs on spatiotemporal data analysis for economic, social, public health, urban planning, and other research subjects.

## Geospatial Data Catalogs

Some of the popular cloud-computing platforms (e.g., AWS, Google Earth Engine, Microsoft Planetary Computer, NASA's Common Metadata Repository (CMR)) host a lot of publicly available geospatial datasets. This repo compiles the list of all geospatial datasets on these platforms as a CSV file and as a JSON file, making it easier to find and use them programmatically. The list is updated daily.

## Open Data from Cities

As cities continue to grow and become more complex, the need for accessible and comprehensive data has become increasingly important. Open data initiatives have emerged as a solution to this challenge, with many cities providing open data portals that allow the public to access and use city data in various ways. Open data provided by cities can enable greater transparency and accountability, support evidence-based decision making, foster innovation and economic growth, and engage citizens in the development of their communities. This has led to a growing movement of cities embracing open data and using it as a tool to improve the quality of life for their residents.
